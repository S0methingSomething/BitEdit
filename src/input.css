  This imports Tailwind's base styles, component classes, and utility classes.
  For Tailwind CSS v4, this is the primary way to include Tailwind's core.
  Your tailwind.config.js will be used to configure what utilities are generated.

/* You can add any additional global base styles or custom CSS here if needed.
  For example, if you want to ensure your CSS variables from the :root 
  in index.html are globally available or apply some very specific global styles
  that are not easily achievable with utility classes.

  Example:
  body {
    font-family: var(--font-inter, sans-serif); // If you define --font-inter
  }
*/

/*
  If you have custom components that you want to define using @layer,
  you can do that here too.
  Example:
  @layer components {
    .custom-button {
      @apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md;
    }
  }
